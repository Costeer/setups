# My Setups


## Niagara Setup Nothing Inspired
Its very minimal and inspired by the idea behind nothing os I tried to be very conservative when applying red accents because I think that most setups overuse it a bit 

##### To get to the stuff I used 
- Launcher

Niagara (pro altho the none pro should look the same)

##### Widgets

- Nothing 2.0 kwgt

Icon Pack made with icon pack studio (set everything to black)

##### Other customisation
custom rooted ROM (paranoid android on Redmi Note 11)

Iconify to customize lock screen clock and quick settings menu as well as custom battery icon

colorBlender used to make amoled material you theme
